"Custodial walks for schools/Monthly Metric
What did we do to get there
- tested the app with real data and with every school - NT testing
- beta test data with service star - look at criteria and give feedback
- Training for schools on how to use and beta test for them
- schedule first walk through with schools and prep for that with (debrief, CFS, expectation setting, comparing data between NT and School team)
- Get schools to schedule walk times and add us to invites
- set deadlines for what needs to get done
- roll out metric to DFO/Facilities and criteria for walks
- have structure for sending data and who data goes to
- deadlines for getting this done and getting data in
- Debrieing with Service Star adn meeting structure.

- apps wasn't tested and done on time
- didn't hold campuses accountable - didn't set deadline to check in on schools, didn't send affirmations and reminders
